<p class="MsoNormal"><big>If you are interested in refrigerated trucking, you may want
to know what it costs. You may also be wondering what equipment you need for
reefer trucking, and how to properly maintain your truck. Fortunately, this
article covers many of these issues, as well as how to get a truck that meets
all of these criteria. Read on to find out how to get started. After you have
completed the above steps, you can begin thinking about purchasing a reefer
truck.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Costs of refrigerated trucking</span><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Compared to standard trucks, refrigerated trucking is more
expensive, particularly for LTL loads. This is because refrigerated trucks
require complex equipment and high utility bills. However, companies with
experience in refrigerated trucking have policies and procedures in place to
minimize expenses. The following are common costs associated with refrigerated
trucking. If you're a first-timer in this field, keep in mind that refrigerated
trucks are more expensive than standard trucks.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.isuzujp.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">garbage truck</span></a><o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The cost to rent a 16-foot refrigerated truck can range from
$160 to $350 a day. Rental companies usually charge $0.2 per mile or $1.2 per
reefer meter hour. In contrast, a 26-foot-long refrigerated truck can cost up
to $700 a week. Rental prices vary, but in general, the larger the truck, the
higher the cost.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big>Equipment needed for reefer trucking<o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Whether you are hauling perishable produce or medical
supplies, the equipment needed for reefer trucking is essential to keep your
cargo cool. While regular cargo is easy to clean after it has been unloaded,
the risk of spoiling perishable goods outweighs the benefits of keeping it
cold. The best transportation carriers plan routes that are flexible and
adaptable enough to accommodate any unforeseen events. This type of
transportation allows you to maximize your capacity and minimize the risk of
OS&amp;D.<o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The equipment used for reefer trucking includes trailers
that can accommodate a wide variety of cargo. These trailers can be larger than
traditional dry vans, so it is vital to choose a trailer with plenty of space.
The truck must also be able to accommodate a variety of types of cargo. Whether
you're transporting produce, groceries, or even a combination of both, reefer
trucking requires careful attention to temperature controls.</big><br />

<h2><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements for reefer trucking</span><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Reefer trucks must be able to maintain a certain temperature
in order to safely transport perishable goods. Refrigeration is necessary to
ensure that the food stays at the proper temperature during transport. The temperature
inside the truck must remain stable, regardless of its speed and distance
traveled. Truckers must also be equipped with monitoring equipment to monitor
the cooling system. These trucks must be plugged into the yard to ensure the
cold chain is not tampered with during transport.<o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Many shippers have different requirements for their reefer
loads. For example, ice cream must stay within a specific temperature range in
order to keep freshness intact. Strawberries, on the other hand, must stay
between 32 and 36 degrees. These requirements only add to the complexity of a
reefer load. While most shippers deal with distribution centers or grocery
chains, some locations may require special handling. Therefore, it is critical
to have a good reefer trucking service.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintenance of reefer truck</span><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The proper maintenance of a reefer truck is crucial to the
continued functionality of the vehicle. The constant temperatures of the
vehicle are critical for the safe transport of perishable food products.
Without proper refrigeration, food products may spoil or develop mold. Proper
maintenance is a key aspect of reefer truck operation, and certified service
centers are available across the United States. Listed below are a few tips on
how to properly maintain a reefer truck.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.isuzujp.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">dump truck</span></a><o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The driver of a reefer unit must perform regular maintenance
on the unit to ensure its efficiency. Routine maintenance is also critical to
avoiding breakdowns during transit. It puts operators ahead of problems that
could lead to product loss. Basic maintenance practices include checking the
alternator and the starter of the diesel engine. Alternators should be replaced
when there is obvious degradation. Proper maintenance also includes checking
the cooling system valve clearance and carbon deposits.</big><o:p /></p>
